            <p>James Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 â€“ September 16, 2007), better known by his pen name Robert
                  Jordan, was an American author of epic fantasy. He is known best for his series The Wheel of Time
                  (finished by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan's death) which comprises 14 books and a prequel novel. He
                  is one of several writers to have written original Conan the Barbarian novels; his are considered by
                  fans to be some of the best of the non-Robert E. Howard efforts. Jordan also published historical
                  fiction using the pseudonym Reagan O'Neal, a western as Jackson O'Reilly, and dance criticism as Chang
                  Lung. Jordan claimed to have ghostwritten an "international thriller" that is still believed to have
                  been written by someone else</p>

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Jordan was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He went to Clemson University after high school, but dropped out
            after one year and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War as a
            helicopter gunner. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star
            with "V" and oak leaf cluster, and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm.</p>

      <p>After returning from Vietnam in 1970, Jordan studied physics at The Citadel. He graduated in 1974 with a
            Bachelor of Science degree and began working for the U.S. Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in
            1977. </p>

      <p>Robert Jordan was a history buff and enjoyed hunting, fishing, sailing, poker, chess, pool, and
            pipe-collecting. He described himself as a "High church" Episcopalian[7] and received communion more than
            once a week.[8] Politically, he described himself as a "libertarian monarchist".[9] He lived with his wife,
            Harriet McDougal, who works as a book editor (currently with Tor Books; she was also Jordan's editor) in a
            house built in 1797.[10] He listed John D. MacDonald, Jane Austen, Louis L'Amour, Charles Dickens, Robert A.
            Heinlein, Mark Twain and Montaigne as his favorite authors</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Illness and death</h2>
      <p>On March 23, 2006, Jordan disclosed that he had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis and that, with
            treatment, his median life expectancy was four years. In a separate weblog post, he encouraged his fans
            not to worry about him and stated that he intended to have a long and creative life.

            He began chemotherapy at Mayo Clinic during early April 2006. He participated in a study of the drug
            Revlimid, which had been approved recently for multiple myeloma but not yet tested for primary
            amyloidosis.

            Jordan died on September 16, 2007, from complications stemming from Multiple Myeloma. His funeral
            service was on September 19, 2007. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the churchyard of St. James
            Church in Goose Creek, outside Charleston, South Carolina.

            Jordan's papers can be found in the special collections of the College of Charleston.</p>
