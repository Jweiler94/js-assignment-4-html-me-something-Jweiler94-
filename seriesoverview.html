                        <p> At the dawn of time, a deity known as the Creator forged the universe and the Wheel of Time,
                              which spins the Pattern of the Ages using the lives of men and women as its threads. The
                              Wheel has seven spokes, each representing an age, and it is rotated by the One Power,
                              which flows from the True Source. The One Power is divided into male and female halves,
                              saidin and saidar, which work in opposition and in unison to drive the Wheel. Humans who
                              can use its power are known as channelers; their principal organization is called the Aes
                              Sedai or "Servants of All" in the Old Tongue.</p>
                        <p> The Creator imprisoned its antithesis, "Shai'tan", the Dark One, at the moment of creation,
                              sealing him away from the Wheel. However, in a time called the Age of Legends, an Aes
                              Sedai experiment inadvertently breached the Dark One's prison, allowing his influence to
                              seep back into the world. He rallied the proud, the corrupt, and the ambitious to his
                              cause and these servants began an effort to fully free the Dark One from his prison, so he
                              might remake time and reality in his own image. In response to this threat, the Wheel spun
                              out the Dragon, a channeler of immense power, to be a champion for the Light. In the Age
                              of Legends, the Dragon was a man named Lews Therin Telamon, who eventually rose to command
                              the Aes Sedai and their allies in the struggle against the Dark One's forces. After a
                              grueling 10-year war, Lews Therin led his forces to victory in a daring assault on the
                              volcano of Shayol Ghul (the site of the earthly link to the Dark One's prison) and was
                              able to reseal the prison. However, at the moment of victory, the Dark One was able to
                              taint saidin, driving male channelers of the One Power insane. Lews Therin killed his
                              friends and family and then, by intentionally overloading himself with the One Power,
                              killed himself. The other male channelers devastated the world with the One Power,
                              unleashing earthquakes and tidal waves that reshaped the world. Eventually, the last male
                              channeler was killed or cut off from the One Power, leaving the human race all but
                              destroyed and only women able to wield the One Power safely. The Aes Sedai reconstituted
                              and guided humanity out of this dark time. Mankind now lived under the shadow of a
                              prophecy that the Dark One would break free from his prison and the Dragon would be reborn
                              to fight him once more, and although he is humanity's only hope against the Dark One, he
                              would devastate the world a second time in the process. </p>
                        <p> After a span of three thousand years, the human race has rebuilt a level of technology
                              roughly comparable to that of the Late Middle Ages or Early Modern Era, though with a
                              higher level of general education and understanding of hygiene and anatomy, but
                              nevertheless an almost complete lack of formal science, industrial production, and
                              academic institutions. This can be traced to the post-apocalyptic nature of the world,
                              where much knowledge has survived, but the structures and institutions that made that
                              knowledge possible were destroyed. One major difference from our history is that women
                              enjoy full equality with men in most societies, and are superior in some. This is
                              attributed to the power and prestige of the female-only Aes Sedai influencing the larger
                              society. </p>
                        <p> Several major wars have ravaged the main continent since the defeat of the Dark One, such as
                              the Trolloc Wars, when the surviving servants of the Dark One tried to destroy
                              civilization once more but were defeated by an alliance of nations led by the Aes Sedai;
                              and the War of the Hundred Years, a devastating civil war that followed the fall of a
                              continent-spanning empire ruled by the high king, Artur Hawkwing. These wars have
                              prevented the human race from regaining the power and high technology of the Age of
                              Legends and also left humanity divided. Even the prestige of the Aes Sedai has fallen,
                              with their shrinking numbers and the emergence of rival organizations such as the Children
                              of the Light, a military order who believe that all who channel the One Power are servants
                              of the Shadow. The nations of the modern era are able to unite in defense against the
                              warrior-clans of the Aiel, who cross into the western kingdoms on a mission of vengeance
                              after they suffer a grievous insult, but are too divided to work effectively together in
                              other areas.</p>

                              <p> New Spring describes events that take place twenty years before the events of The Eye
                                    of the World (Book 1). The story begins in the last days of the Aiel War, and the
                                    Battle of the Shining Walls around Tar Valon. It is set primarily in Tar Valon and
                                    the Borderlands, specifically Kandor.</p>
                              <p> New Spring focuses mainly on <a href=characters.html/#moirainedamodred>Morraine
                                          Damodred</a> and Siuan Sanche, two Aes Sedai new to the sisterhood, and how a
                                    young Moiraine became Aes Sedai, met <a href=characters.html/#lanmandragoran>Lan
                                          Mandragoran</a> and made him her Warder. The novel also explains how Moiraine
                                    and Siuan witnessed a prophecy of the <a
                                          href=characters.html/#thedragon>Dragon's</a> rebirth and came to begin
                                    investigating the Karaethon Cycle, the Prophecies of the Dragon, decades before
                                    discovering Rand al'Thor.</p>
                              <p> The novel starts with the return of the Aiel to the Aiel Waste, and a Foretelling by
                                    the Keeper of the Chronicles, Gitara Moroso, that the Dragon has been reborn.
                                    Moiraine, Siuan and the Amyrlin Seat Tamra Ospenya are the only people to witness
                                    the foretelling. </p>
                              <p> New Spring was originally published January 6th, 2004, and Robert Jordan is the sole
                                    author credited. New Spring was adapted into a series of graphic novel published
                                    between July 2005 and May 2010.</p>

                                    the Trollocs) intent on capturing Rand, Mat, and Perrin. To save their village from
                                    further attacks, Rand, Mat, Perrin, and Egwene flee it, accompanied by the Aes Sedai
                                    Moiraine Damodred, her Warder Al'Lan Mandragoran, and gleeman Thom Merrilin, and
                                    later joined by Wisdom Nynaeve al'Meara. Pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs
                                    and Myrddraal, the travellers take refuge in the abandoned city of Shadar Logoth,
                                    where Mat steals a cursed dagger, thus becoming infected by the malevolent Mashadar.
                                    While escaping the city the travelers are separated; Rand, Mat, and Thom travel by
                                    boat to Whitebridge, where Thom is lost allowing Rand and Mat to escape a Myrddraal.
                                    In Caemlyn, Rand befriends an Ogier named Loial. Trying to catch a glimpse of the
                                    recently captured False Dragon, Rand befriends Elayne Trakand, heir apparent to the
                                    throne of Andor, and her brothers Gawyn Trakand and Galad Damodred. Rand is then
                                    taken before Queen Morgase, her Aes Sedai advisor, Elaida; and Captain-General of
                                    the Queen's Guard Gareth Bryne, and released without charge, in spite of Elaida's
                                    grave pronouncements regarding Rand.

                              <p> Egwene and Perrin are guided separately to Caemlyn by Elyas Machera, a man who can
                                    communicate telepathically with wolves and who claims that Perrin can do the same.
                                    The three run afoul of the Children of the Light, where Perrin kills two for the
                                    death of a wolf at their hands and is sentenced to death. Moiraine, Lan, and Nynaeve
                                    rescue Egwene and Perrin, and all are reunited with Rand and Mat. Thereafter
                                    Moiraine determines that Mat must travel to Tar Valon, the Aes Sedai's center of
                                    power, to overcome the influence of Shadar Logoth.</p>
                              <p> Loial warns Moiraine of a threat to the Eye of the World, a pool of Saidin untouched
                                    by the Dark One's influence, which is confirmed by vivid and disturbing dreams Mat,
                                    Rand, and Perrin have had. The Eye of the World is protected by Someshta (the Green
                                    Man) and contains one of the seven seals on the Dark One's prison, the Dragon banner
                                    of Lews Therin Telamon, and the Horn of Valere. At the civilized world's border, the
                                    group enters the Blight (the polluted region under the Dark One's control) to
                                    protect the Eye. After a pursuit, they meet the Green Man and he reveals the Eye.
                                    The group is then confronted by the Forsaken Aginor and Balthamel. As the battle
                                    ensues, Balthamel and the Green Man slay each other. Soon after, Rand defeats Aginor
                                    and uses the Eye to decimate the Trolloc army and defeat Ba'alzamon. As a result,
                                    Moiraine concludes that Rand is the Dragon Reborn, but her opinion and all other
                                    details of the final battle are kept from all the male members of the group except
                                    Lan.</p>

                              <p> At Fal Dara in Shienar, following the events in The Eye of the World, the protagonists
                                    are visited by the Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, who identifies Rand al'Thor as the
                                    Dragon Reborn. Mat's condition worsens through his psychic attachment to a parasitic
                                    dagger. Lan Mandragoran instructs Rand in sword fighting. Darkfriend Padan Fain is
                                    imprisoned but subsequently freed by Darkforces, stealing the Horn of Valere and the
                                    tainted dagger. Rand, Perrin Aybara, and Mat accompany a Shienaran party southbound
                                    in pursuit, under the leadership of Lord Ingtar and guided by a tracker named Hurin.
                                    Nynaeve al'Meara and Egwene al'Vere accompany Moraine to Tar Valon for Aes Sedai
                                    training, where they befriend Elayne Trakand and the clairvoyant Min. There, Nynaeve
                                    passes the test to become Accepted, a rank in the White Tower below Aes Sedai and
                                    above a Novice.</p>
                              <p> Rand, Loial, and Hurin are separated from the Shienaran party and transported to an
                                    alternate world; similar to their own, but deserted and distorted. Rand suspects
                                    that he activated the portal stone by unconsciously channeling saidin in his sleep,
                                    although Egwene dreams that a mysterious woman (later identified as Lanfear) is
                                    responsible. Rand's struggle to accept his channeling ability is a recurring element
                                    in the novel. In this alternate world, Rand meets Ba'alzamon and has a heron's image
                                    (the crest of his sword) branded into his palm in a fight. Later, with the help of
                                    the mysterious but beautiful Selene, they return to their own world, ahead of Fain's
                                    and Ingtar's groups. This done, they recover the Horn and dagger. At a loss to
                                    explain Rand's disappearance, Lord Ingtar's group pursue Padan Fain with the aid of
                                    Perrin, who uses a telepathic ability to communicate with wolves.</p>
                              <p> Rand's party journeys to Cairhien, where Rand finds gleeman Thom Merrilin, whom he
                                    thought dead in The Eye of the World. Rand and Loial are attacked by Trollocs (the
                                    Dark One's bestial foot-soldiers) and, during their escape, destroy the Chapter
                                    House of the Illuminator's Guild, a society retaining knowledge of fireworks. The
                                    Horn and dagger are again lost. Later, Thom's apprentice Dena is murdered for Thom's
                                    involvement with Rand.</p>
                              <p> With the aid of Perrin, Ingtar's group is reunited with Rand, and they learn that the
                                    Horn has been taken to the port city of Falme in Toman Head. To gain time, Rand
                                    tries to lead them through an alternate world; but instead loses time. Meanwhile,
                                    the invading Seanchan and their exotic beasts have occupied Falme. Geofram Bornhald,
                                    leader of the zealous religious group Children of the Light, is preparing to attack
                                    the Seanchan. At the White Tower, Liandrin lures Egwene and Nynaeve, along with
                                    Elayne and Min, to Toman Head, where Min is captured by the Seanchan and Egwene is
                                    collared with an a'dam: a device used by the Seanchan to control channelers. Nynaeve
                                    and Elayne escape.</p>
                              <p> At Falme, Rand slays High Lord Turak of the Seanchan before escaping with the Horn and
                                    dagger. Ingtar reveals himself as a Darkfriend, but redeems himself when he dies
                                    fighting for Rand's group. Elayne and Nynaeve rescue Egwene from the Seanchan and
                                    attempt to flee the city. At this moment the Whitecloaks also attack, leaving the
                                    heroes trapped between the Seanchan and the Whitecloaks; whereupon Mat blows the
                                    Horn of Valere, resurrecting dead heroes including Artur Hawkwing, which overcome
                                    the Seanchan and vanish. Rand himself vanquishes Ba'alzamon, but is himself wounded,
                                    and in doing so projects an image of their duel to numerous peoples.</p>

                              <p> Rand al'Thor, having been declared the Dragon Reborn by Moiraine Damodred, secretly
                                    goes to Tear to prove himself. Along the way he is hunted by Darkhounds and
                                    Darkfriends. After leaving in secret, Moiraine, Lan Mandragoran, the Ogier Loial,
                                    and Perrin Aybara follow always one step behind. Rand leaves in his trail a pattern
                                    of weddings and strange events. Perrin comes across an Aiel warrior that was
                                    captured and in a cage. He frees him, earning a friendship with Gaul, a Stone Dog,
                                    who will accompany Perrin on his travels. This event is witnessed by a hunter of the
                                    horn, Zarine Bashere (alias Faile), who joins the party as well.</p>
                              <p> Min reports to the Amyrlin Seat, while Moiraine, Lan, Loial, Zarine and Perrin follow
                                    Rand. En route they battle Darkhounds, and discover that the Forsaken Sammael rules
                                    in Illian.</p>
                              <p> Mat Cauthon is taken to Tar Valon by Verin Mathwin, Nynaeve al'Meara, Egwene al'Vere,
                                    Elayne Trakand, and Hurin. Immediately after arrival in Tar Valon, Hurin departs to
                                    report to King Easar in Shienar. The Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, sets Nynaeve,
                                    Egwene, and later Elayne, to hunting down the Black Ajah, and therefore to Tear.</p>
                              <p> In the White Tower, through the use of a sa'angreal by Aes Sedai, Mat is healed of the
                                    corruptive influence of the ruby dagger of Shadar Logoth. Once healed Mat defeats
                                    Galad Damodred and Gawyn Trakand in a practice sword battle, using a quarterstaff.
                                    This wins him enough money to gamble with and purchase passage away from Tar Valon;
                                    at which point he is approached by Nynaeve, Egwene and Elayne to deliver a letter to
                                    her mother Queen Morgase. Mat reunites with Thom Merrilin, and they together travel
                                    to Andor, where Mat delivers the letter and learns of a plot by Queen Morgase's
                                    lover, Lord Gaebril, to murder Elayne. To prevent that murder, Mat pursues the
                                    killers to Tear.</p>
                              <p> In Tear, Nynaeve, Egwene, and Elayne are betrayed by Juilin Sandar (under the
                                    influence of Liandrin) to the Black Ajah and imprisoned in the Stone of Tear, whence
                                    they are rescued by Mat and a repentant Juilin. Faile falls into a trap meant for
                                    Moiraine, and Perrin risks his life to rescue her. Rand and the Forsaken Be'lal duel
                                    in the Stone of Tear, until Moiraine kills Be'lal with balefire. Ba'alzamon disables
                                    Moiraine and attacks Rand, whereupon Rand takes Callandor (a more powerful
                                    sa'angreal), and apparently kills Ba'alzamon; but Moiraine argues that the Dark One,
                                    having no tangible body, is not represented by the dead man. Egwene, remembering a
                                    prophecy, instead deduces that the corpse is possibly Ishamael, Chief among the
                                    Forsaken. The Aiel in Tear conquer the Stone in loyalty to Rand.</p>

                              <p> Rand al'Thor has just claimed the crystal sword Callandor to prove himself the Dragon
                                    Reborn. He is approached by Lanfear, who tells him of the Forsaken's plans. However,
                                    the fortress known as the Stone of Tear is stormed by Trollocs and Fades, sent by
                                    another Forsaken (Sammael), while a third, Semirhage, sends her followers into the
                                    Stone, to oppose Sammael's forces. In defense, Rand uses Callandor to create a
                                    lightning storm killing all the Trollocs and Fades. </p>
                              <p> Rand then decides that he must travel to the Aiel Waste, to be acknowledged as the
                                    Aiel's prophesied leader. Before leaving, Rand, Mat Cauthon, and Moiraine Damodred
                                    visit a ter'angreal that lets them talk to a mysterious snakelike race called the
                                    Aelfinn, who seemingly know the answer to any question. Mat learns from them that he
                                    must go to Rhuidean or die and also that he is destined to marry someone called "the
                                    Daughter of the Nine Moons". Egwene al'Vere and the Aiel woman Aviendha are also
                                    summoned to the Aiel Waste, Egwene to learn Dreamwalking and Aviendha to become a
                                    Wise One. Thus, Rand, Mat, Moiraine, Egwene, and Aviendha all travel to the Aiel
                                    Waste. </p>
                              <p> Other characters in the Stone of Tear also learn that they must travel elsewhere.
                                    Perrin Aybara hears of trouble in The Two Rivers, his native region, and returns
                                    thereto, accompanied by Faile Bashere, Loial, and three Aiel warriors: Gaul, Bain,
                                    and Chiad. Elayne Trakand, Nynaeve al'Meara, and Thom Merrilin depart to Tarabon to
                                    hunt the Black Ajah. Finally, Min Farshaw arrives in Tar Valon to report to the
                                    Amyrlin Siuan Sanche. Thus, The Shadow Rising follows four groups of characters in
                                    four plotlines. </p>
                              <h4>Aiel Waste</h4>
                              <p> Rand uses a portal stone to transport Mat, Egwene, Moiraine, and the Aiel from the
                                    Stone of Tear to the Aiel Waste, and are met by Taardad and Shaido Aiel. Moiraine,
                                    Aviendha, Mat, and Rand enter the legendary, forbidden city of the waste, Rhuidean;
                                    where each enters a ter'angreal</p>
                              <p> While inside his ter'angreal, Rand relives portions of his paternal ancestors lives
                                    (before and after the Breaking), and discovers the Aiel were once pacifists serving
                                    the Aes Sedai. Adherence to pacifism still lives on in the Tinkers, while others
                                    known as the 'Jenn Aiel', transported a large collection of angreal, sa'angreal, and
                                    ter'angreal to Rhuidean. Rand emerges from the ter'angreal with dragon markings on
                                    both arms; proof that he is the Car'a'carn: the 'Chief of Chiefs' of the Aiel. Mat
                                    enters his ter'angreal (similar to the one he previously entered in Tear) seeking
                                    more answers from the 'Aelfinn'. Instead, Mat encounters the Foxlike 'Eelfinn' who
                                    bargain for gifts versus answering questions. Mat ignorantly requests several gifts
                                    from them: fluency in the Old Tongue, memories of his own ancestors, a spear called
                                    an ashandarei, and a medallion ter'angreal that protects against the One Power.
                                    Afterwards Rand finds Mat hanging from the Tree of Life (the price for the gifts he
                                    received). After revival by Rand, Mat dons a black scarf to hide the scars around
                                    his neck. Moiraine visits the three-hooped ter'angreal used by the Wise Ones,
                                    gaining limited knowledge of the future. </p>
                              <p> The Wise Ones task Aviendha with teaching Rand the Aiel customs as they travel to Cold
                                    Rocks Hold. They are met en route by darkfriends and Forsaken disguised as
                                    merchants. After arrival at Al'cair Dal, both Rand al'Thor and Couladin of the
                                    Shaido Aiel claim to be the messiah 'He Who Comes With the Dawn'. To validate his
                                    claim, Rand reveals the secret history of the Aiel during the Age of Legends, but
                                    this incites an uproar among the Aiel. Rand prevents a riot by wielding The One
                                    Power and summons a rainstorm to the Aiel Waste. The Forsaken Asmodean uses the
                                    momentary in-fighting amongst the Aiel as cover to seek out the ter'angreal access
                                    keys to the Choedan Kal (the most powerful sa'angreal ever created). Rand chases
                                    Asmodean to Rhuidean where both simultaneously grasp the access key. The sudden
                                    power surge enables Rand to sever Asmodean's link to the Dark One (which marks
                                    Asmodean as a traitor to the rest of the Forsaken). Asmodean begrudgingly relents to
                                    teach Rand how to channel the One Power after Lanfear coerces him by hobbling
                                    Asmodean's own access to the One Power. Rand returns to Al'cair Dal to find most of
                                    the Aiel now acknowledge him as the Car'a'carn. </p>
                              <h4>The Two Rivers</h4>
                              <p> Padan Fain drives the Children of the Light to the Two Rivers to exact vengeance on
                                    Rand. The Shadow deploys Slayer, a mysterious and powerful agent, with a large host
                                    of Trollocs to kill Fain; endangering the Two Rivers. Perrin's homecoming is dashed
                                    with tragedy when he learns Trollocs have killed his family. Perrin rallies new
                                    allies; Verin Mathwin, Alanna Mosvani, Aes Sedai searching for potential pupils, and
                                    the Tinker Aram (who has abandoned his people's pacifism) to fight the Trollocs. It
                                    is revealed later that it was in fact Fain who killed Perrin's family. With the help
                                    of Tam al'Thor (Rand's adoptive father) and Abell Cauthon (Mat's father), Perrin
                                    recruits the people of the Two Rivers to fight for themselves. Perrin leads the Two
                                    Rivers against the Trollocs, and earns the nicknames 'Lord Perrin' and 'Perrin
                                    Goldeneyes.' Before the showdown with the Trollocs, Perrin marries Faile and tasks
                                    her with travelling to Caemlyn and asking Queen Morgase to lend soldiers in their
                                    fight. The Children of the Light, led by Dain Bornhald, interject themselves and
                                    demand Perrin's arrest to try him for the murders of other whitecloaks. Perrin
                                    agrees to give himself up, if the Children will fight alongside the Two Rivers when
                                    the Trollocs attack. Slayer is killing wolves in Tel'aran'rhiod, but retreats when
                                    he is attacked and defeated by Perrin. Despite their loss of Perrin, the Trollocs
                                    are defeated by the Two Rivers forces. The Children of the Light reneged on their
                                    agreement (and sat out the battle with the Trollocs), so Perrin and the Two Rivers
                                    folk force the Children to leave. With his plans ruined, Fain departs for the White
                                    Tower. </p>
                              <h4>Tanchico in Tarabon</h4>
                              <p> Nynaeve and Elayne, along with Thom Merrilin and Juilin Sandar, are taken to Tanchico
                                    by the Sea Folk, who reveal their own prophecies about Rand. They meet Bayle Domon
                                    and a Seanchan woman, Egeanin. During their mission to smoke out the Black Ajah,
                                    they also encounter Moghedien, one of the Forsaken. They discover that the enemy's
                                    goal is a male a'dam, held in the private collection of the Panarch Amathera, which
                                    they plan to use to control Rand. Nynaeve and Elayne save Amathera from the Black
                                    Ajah and take the a'dam and a seal on the Dark One's prison from her palace. At this
                                    moment, Moghedien attacks them and personally duels Nynaeve, finding that they are
                                    roughly equal in power. Nynaeve defeats Moghedien and shields her, but the Black
                                    Ajah cause a distraction with a balefire-creating ter'angreal, letting Moghedien
                                    escape. Finally, they send Domon and Egeanin to destroy the a'dam. </p>
                              <h4>White Tower</h4>
                              <p> Min continues to report to the Amyrlin and tries to avoid suspicion by taking the
                                    guise of Elmindreda, a giddy, empty-headed woman. However, she finds herself caught
                                    in a coup: Elaida and her supporters depose Siuan and Leane Sharif, her Keeper of
                                    the Chronicles, for secretly aiding Rand. Siuan and Leane are both "stilled" (their
                                    ability to channel the One Power removed) and Elaida becomes the next Amyrlin. Min
                                    frees Siuan and Leane, and all three are assisted in escape by Gawyn Trakand. Gawyn
                                    has joined the coup on Elaida's side, and killed several Siuan supporters, but Min
                                    convinces him to turn a blind eye to their escape as a personal favor for her.
                                    Logain Ablar, a former False Dragon who has been "gentled" (the male equivalent of
                                    "stilling"), joins their escape from Tar Valon. </p>

                              <p> In Rhuidean, worried by news that Aiel from other clans join the cause of his enemy
                                    Couladin, Rand al’Thor confers with the Clan Chiefs who have recognised him as the
                                    Car’a’carn – Chief of Chiefs – on how to win over the four remaining Clans.
                                    Darkhounds attack and he kills them with balefire, a powerful weave that burns a
                                    person's thread backwards through the Pattern, undoing his past actions for a short
                                    time prior to being consumed by balefire. Egwene al'Vere continues to chafe under
                                    the instruction of Aiel Wise Ones, eager to learn faster than they think is wise,
                                    and Moiraine Damodred grows increasingly desperate to find her way into Rand’s
                                    circle of trust.</p>
                              <p> n Tanchico, Nynaeve and Elayne set out for the White Tower -- only to receive news
                                    that it has suffered a schism. Elaida, a Red sister and former advisor to Queen
                                    Morgase Trakand, has deposed and replaced the Former Amyrlin Seat and ally Siuan
                                    Sanche. </p>
                              <p> Unwilling to accept an outsider as their prophesied hero, the Shaido and their allies
                                    follow Couladin across the Dragonwall to conquer the “treekillers” and wetlanders.
                                    Rand leads the seven Aiel Clans who have recognised him in pursuit and is followed
                                    in turn by the four of the undecided Aiel Clans. Along the way they are ambushed by
                                    Darkfriends and Shadowspawn but arrive in time to save the city of Cairhien and
                                    defeat the Shaido, in part thanks to the memories of long dead generals the Eelfinn
                                    have placed in Matrim Cauthon’s mind. Couladin is killed in single combat by Mat,
                                    while Rand is attacked from afar by either Rahvin or Sammael during the course of
                                    the battle. </p>
                              <p> As Rand establishes his control of Cairhien, a nation torn apart by scheming and war,
                                    he learns that the Forsaken Rahvin has deposed Queen Morgase who is presumed dead.
                                    Furious at himself for not acting sooner, Rand prepares to travel to Andor
                                    personally and kill Rahvin in revenge, but is delayed by Moiraine. Lanfear attacks
                                    Rand who is unwilling to fight back. Rand is saved by the sacrifice of Moirane who
                                    foresaw Lanfear’s attack. </p>
                              <p> Siuan, Leane and Min make way to Salidar, where the Aes Sedai who have escaped the
                                    Tower after Elaida's coup have made a temporary base. Siuan subtely convinces
                                    Sheriam and the other Aes Sedai there that they must support Rand. Gareth Bryne
                                    follows shortly afer, in pursuit of Siuan, and the Aes Sedai have him agree to help
                                    build an army for them. </p>
                              <p> Meanwhile Nynaeve and Elayne seek out the rebel Aes Sedai accompanied by Thom and
                                    Juilin, discovering the forkroot herb that incapacitates channelers. Stuck in cities
                                    that are occupied by the Whitecloaks and with Elaida's agents trying to capture
                                    Elayne, they disguise themselves and join a travelling circus menagerie, performing
                                    acts through villages and towns. Despite Egwene warning Nynaeve through a dream
                                    about the dangers of the world of dreams, Nynaeve still visits Telaranrhiod alone
                                    trying to work with Birgitte to track the forsaken Moghedien. Eventually Moghedien
                                    traps Nynaeve and Birigitte in the world of dreams, and the pair narrowly escapes,
                                    however at the cost of Birigitte being pushed into the waking world severely
                                    injured. Elayne bonds Birigitte as her warder to help save her life. </p>
                              <p> The girls make way to Samara, which is rife with troubles. Masema - who has named
                                    himself the prophet and taken over the city with zealous followers of the dragon
                                    reborn - and the Whitecloaks who have entered the town are on the brink of war.
                                    Nynaeve meets Galad there again, who has joined the Whitecloaks. Both he and Masema
                                    promise to help them get a ship to escape the city. After much trouble, Nynaeve,
                                    Elayne, Thom and Juilin, now accompanied by a band of Shienaran soldiers make way to
                                    Salidar. </p>
                              <p> Nynaeve confronts Moghedien in a dream again, but this time she is successful in
                                    ensnaring her with an a'dam. Finding out that Rand may be in danger, she drags the
                                    forsaken along to help save him through the world of dreams. </p>
                              <p> Rand Skims to Caemlyn, where his forces enter a trap laid by Rahvin. Lightning bolts
                                    triggered by Rahvin kill Mat, Asmodean and Aviendha, which causes Rand to recklessly
                                    attack the Forsaken. His battle with Rahvin leads him into the world of dreams,
                                    where with the assistance of Nynaeve he destroys Rahvin with Balefire. Upon
                                    returning to the waking world, he discovers that his balefire undid Rahvin's
                                    killings of Mat, Aviendha and Asmodean. Before waking Nynaeve realises Moghedien is
                                    posing as a refugee in the rebel Aes Sedai camp and doses her with forkroot,
                                    allowing her to be captured in the real world. </p>

                              <p> With many of the seals on his prison broken, the Dark One has grown in power. He
                                    causes global warming, revives the Forsaken Aginor and Balthamel as Osan'gar and
                                    Aran'gar, and creates Shaidar Haran, his Myrddraal incarnation. </p>
                              <p> In response to Rand al'Thor's amnesty on male channelers, Mazrim Taim swears
                                    allegiance to him. Together they form the Black Tower, which trains male channelers
                                    called Asha'man. Rand is diplomatically courted by both the rebel Aes Sedai in
                                    Salidar, who send an envoy to Caemlyn, and the Aes Sedai of the White Tower, who
                                    send an envoy (many of which are in fact Black Ajah) to Cairhien. In an unsuccessful
                                    attempt to control Rand, Alanna Mosvani of the rebel Aes Sedai bonds Rand as her
                                    Warder against his will. Additionally, Min Farshaw, who had traveled with the
                                    Salidar Aes Sedai, reunites with Rand and gives him much-needed emotional support.
                                    Rand later discovers Salidar's location and sends Mat Cauthon there, to retrieve
                                    Elayne Trakand who will rule Caemlyn and Cairhien in his stead.</p>
                              <p> Perrin Aybara leaves the Two Rivers to join Rand in Caemlyn. The deposed Queen of
                                    Andor, Morgase Trakand, goes to Amadicia for aid in returning to the throne but is
                                    instead taken captive by the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light,
                                    Pedron Niall. In Salidar, Elayne and Nynaeve al'Meara have made numerous magical
                                    discoveries thanks to Moghedien, who they secretly hold in captivity. In a feat
                                    previously believed to be impossible even in the Age of Legends, Nynaeve Heals Siuan
                                    Sanche, Leane Sharif, and Logain Ablar, restoring their abilities to channel. Egwene
                                    al'Vere is named the Amyrlin of the rebel Aes Sedai and travels to Salidar through
                                    Tel'aran'rhiod. Upon arrival, she unofficially raises Nynaeve and Elayne to Aes
                                    Sedai and sends them and Aviendha to Ebou Dar to search for a ter'angreal called the
                                    "Bowl of the Winds" to break the Dark One's control of the climate. Mat arrives at
                                    this time and reluctantly goes with them. After their departure, Egwene secretly
                                    arranges the escape of Logain, who then goes to the Black Tower. Aran'gar
                                    infiltrates Salidar and frees Moghedien. </p>
                              <p> Shortly after Perrin joins him, Rand is kidnapped by Elaida's Aes Sedai, who torture
                                    him en route to Tar Valon. Learning of the kidnapping, Perrin leads Rand's followers
                                    to the climactic Battle of Dumai's Wells. At the end of the battle, the rebel Aes
                                    Sedai are forced to swear fealty to the Dragon Reborn while the surviving White
                                    Tower Aes Sedai remain captives. </p>

                              <h4>Plotline 1: Rand al'Thor</h4>
                              <p> Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, prepares to attack the Forsaken Sammael in Illian
                                    while enjoying life with his friend, Min Farshaw, and attempting to quell the
                                    rebellion by nobles in Cairhien, during which Padan Fain severely injures him. After
                                    recovering, Rand, accompanied by Asha'man, defeats Sammael in Shadar Logoth, where
                                    Sammael is destroyed by Mashadar. Rand then takes the crown of Illian: formerly the
                                    Laurel Crown, but now called the 'Crown of Swords'.</p>
                              <h4>Plotline 2: Aes Sedai</h4>
                              <p> Egwene al'Vere and Siuan Sanche attempt to manipulate the Aes Sedai in Salidar against
                                    Elaida's Aes Sedai in the White Tower. Investigating Myrelle Berengari, Egwene
                                    exploits the transfer of Lan Mandragoran's Warder bond from Moiraine to Myrelle, to

                              <h4>Plotline 3: Ebou Dar</h4>
                              <p> In the city of Ebou Dar in Altara, Elayne Trakand, Nynaeve al'Meara, Aviendha, and Mat
                                    Cauthon search for a ter'angreal, the Bowl of the Winds, to break the unnatural heat
                                    brought by the Dark One's manipulation of climate. They find it and enlist the help
                                    of the Kin and the Atha'an Miere. They also confront a Gholam. Mat is left behind
                                    and caught in the fighting as the Seanchan invade Ebou Dar.</p>

                                    ter'angreal called the 'Bowl of the Winds' to reverse the unnatural heat brought by
                                    the Dark One's manipulation of the climate, and then escape a Seanchan invasion by
                                    Traveling to Andor with most of the Kin who had not yet been captured by the
                                    Seanchan. In Andor, an Aes Sedai in their party is murdered, and the group realizes
                                    that one of its members is Black Ajah. Upon reaching Caemlyn, Elayne initiates her
                                    claim to the throne. </p>
                              <p> Perrin Aybara moves into Ghealdan to stop Masema Dagar, the self-proclaimed Prophet of
                                    the Dragon; but unknowingly rescues the deposed Queen Morgase of Andor from the
                                    Prophet's men. He then secures the oath of fealty from Alliandre, Queen of Ghealdan,
                                    and accepts the dubious allegiance of Masema. At the end of the book, Faile Bashere
                                    is kidnapped by the Shaido Aiel. Egwene al'Vere, Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes
                                    Sedai, manipulates her unruly followers into giving her more control, and they
                                    Travel to Tar Valon, before their siege of its White Tower. </p>
                              <p> Rand al'Thor, accompanied by Bashere with fifty Asha'man and six thousand Tairens,
                                    Cairhienin and Illianers, attempts to repel the Seanchan invasion in Altara. They
                                    are successful in early skirmishes, driving the Seanchan from western Altara
                                    entirely. Bashere counsels retreat, but Rand decides to push on to Ebou Dar,
                                    clashing with a forty thousand strong Seanchan army fifty miles from the city. Both
                                    sides bleed each other white in the initial clash, after which both armies pull back
                                    to regroup. Rand attempts to destroy the Seanchan by wielding his sa'angreal
                                    'Callandor', but loses control of it due to disturbances in saidin caused by the
                                    previous usage of the Bowl of the Winds. The result is a lightning storm that
                                    devastates his army as well as the Seanchan. Too bloodied to continue fighting, both
                                    armies retreat, making the battle a stalemate. Returning to Cairhien, Rand is
                                    attacked by traitorous Asha'man led by Corlan Dashiva, who fail to kill him. Mat
                                    Cauthon is absent from the book, due to injuries sustained at the end of the
                                    previous book, A Crown of Swords. Robert Jordan had earlier done the same for Perrin

                                    Daughter of the Nine Moons, referring to Tuon herself, kidnaps her during his and
                                    his men's escape from the city. </p>
                              <p> Rand al'Thor is appointed a Warder by Elayne Trakand, Aviendha, and Min Farshaw; and
                                    later kills most of the Asha'man traitors in Far Madding. Lan also kills Toram
                                    Riatin in a duel. Caught by guards, Rand is imprisoned for a short time but is set
                                    free by Cadsuane and the other Aes Sedai. Rand and Nynaeve al'Meara Travel to Shadar
                                    Logoth. There, defended by Cadsuane Melaidhrin's Aes Sedai and loyal Asha'man
                                    against the Forsaken, Rand and Nynaeve use the Choedan Kal to cleanse saidin of the
                                    Dark One's influence. In the process, both Shadar Logoth, the access key to the
                                    female Choedan Kal, and the female Choedan Kal itself are destroyed. </p>

                              <p> Perrin Aybara continues trying to rescue his wife Faile Bashere, kidnapped by the
                                    Shaido Aiel, even torturing prisoners for information. In addition, Perrin is
                                    approached with the suggestion of alliance with the Seanchan to defeat the Shaido.
                                    Mat Cauthon continues trying to escape Seanchan territory while courting Tuon, the
                                    heir to the Seanchan leadership. In the process, Mat discovers that Tuon is a
                                    sul'dam and can be taught to channel the One Power. Elayne Trakand continues trying
                                    to solidify her hold on the Lion Throne of Andor. It is revealed that she is
                                    expecting twins; but the identity of the father (Rand) is kept secret from others.
                                    Rand al'Thor sends Davram Bashere, Logain Ablar, and Loial to negotiate a truce with
                                    the Seanchan. They return at the end of the book to tell him that the Seanchan have

                              <h4>Plotline 1: Mat Cauthon</h4>
                              <p> Mat travels into Altara, and Moiraine Damodred is located in the custody of the
                                    Aelfinn and Eelfinn. Attempting to escape Altara, Mat meets Talmanes, who has
                                    brought a large number of Mat's personal army (the Band of the Red Hand), which
                                    contends against a Seanchan force sent to kill Tuon, using fireworks as artillery.
                                    After a series of debates, Tuon marries Mat, giving him the Seanchan title 'Prince
                                    of the Ravens' ostensibly to assure a marriage of convenience. Thereafter, Tuon
                                    returns to Ebou Dar to destroy the treacherous High Lady Suroth and assume command
                                    proper of the Seanchan. </p>
                              <h4>Plotline 2: Rand al'Thor</h4>
                              <p> Rand arranges a meeting with the Daughter of the Nine Moons to negotiate a truce; but
                                    a large-scale battle against a horde of 100,000 Trollocs and Myrdraal ends almost
                                    disastrously, when Lews Therin (Rand's alter-ego) seizes control of saidin.
                                    Thereafter, Rand forges a truce with Lews Therin. The meeting with Tuon comes to a
                                    grisly end upon Rand and crew discovering Semirhage, disguised, in her place. In the
                                    ensuing battle, Semirhage is captured at the cost of Rand's own left hand and
                                    reveals that his mental disorder, which allows him to communicate with his past
                                    self, is almost universally fatal. </p>
                              <h4>Plotline 3: Perrin Aybara</h4>
                              <p> Perrin disperses the Shaido threat and rescues his wife Faile using an alliance with
                                    Seanchan Banner-General Tylee Khirgan. To overcome the large number of Shaido Wise
                                    Ones, they lace the Shaido water supply with Forkroot herbs, which impedes
                                    channeling the One Power. Rand's adoptive father Tam arrives with reinforcements
                                    from the Two Rivers. In the course of the battle, Perrin's protege Aram dies while
                                    attempting to kill him. In the rescue of Faile, the Aiel Rolan is killed by Perrin,
                                    although he and other Aiel had helped Faile and her friends during captivity,
                                    unknown to Perrin. Sevanna is captured and the Shaido, defeated and disgraced, are
                                    led by Therava back to the Aiel Waste, with the Black Sister Galina Casban in tow.
                              </p>
                              <h4>Plotline 4: White Tower Siege</h4>
                              <p> Egwene is captive in the White Tower, but keeps in contact with the rebel Aes Sedai
                                    through Tel'aran'rhiod. Despite harsh disciplining, she spreads rumors and doubt in
                                    the White Tower about Elaida's suitability as Amyrlin. Both the rebels and the White
                                    Tower send Aes Sedai to the Black Tower to bond Asha'man, with the rebels doing so
                                    after Rand offered to counter the number of loyalist Aes Sedai bonded to Asha'man.
                              </p>
                              <h4>Others</h4>
                              <p> Loial is married and speaks to the Ogier of his stedding (which is the name given to
                                    areas that Ogier call home, like a village) that they must assist the human armies.
                                    Then, Loial and his mentor Elder Haman wield axes during the Trolloc attack. Lan
                                    Mandragoran rides to Shienar to fight; but Nynaeve al'Meara takes him to the coast
                                    of the Aryth Ocean at World's End in Saldaea; from there, she goes herself to
                                    recruit Lan's scattered countrymen.</p>
                              <p> Galad Damodred kills Eamon Valda for allegedly killing Queen Morgase of Andor and
                                    becomes the leader of the Whitecloaks, and then, in his capacity as their leader, he
                                    determines to fight alongside Rand's followers. Elayne Trakand becomes Queen of
                                    Andor. Mazrim Taim meets with a group of Red Ajah from the White Tower and agrees to
                                    their proposition: since Sisters were taken and bonded against their will by certain
                                    Asha'man, an equivalent number of Black Tower initiates should be bonded by sisters.

                              <h4>Plotline 1: Rand al'Thor</h4>
                              <p> As Rand's story begins, he is restoring order in the nation of Arad Doman while
                                    searching for Graendal, one of the Dark One's favored servants known as the
                                    Forsaken.[7][8][9] The Aes Sedai work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage, another
                                    Forsaken captured at the end of Knife of Dreams. After being freed by her allies,
                                    Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and
                                    locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell use it to make
                                    him torture and attempt to kill his lover, Min Farshaw. Unable to channel, he
                                    reaches out and inexplicably accesses the True Power, a different power normally
                                    only granted by the Dark One, using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza.
                                    After this, he resolves to make himself harder and emotionless. He banishes his
                                    adviser Cadsuane Melaidhrin for not securing the Domination Band, promising to kill
                                    her if he sees her face again.</p>
                              <p> Rand meets with the Seanchan, a civilization that invaded the continent earlier in the
                                    series. Their leader Tuon rejects Rand's offer of a truce after sensing a dark aura
                                    that emanated from Rand after he channeled the True Power. Following the meeting,
                                    Tuon declares herself Empress and prepares a surprise attack against the White
                                    Tower.</p>
                              <p> Graendal's hiding place is traced to a remote palace. Confirming her presence, Rand
                                    uses the Choedan Kal, a powerful magical artifact, to eliminate the entire building
                                    with balefire, a magic that wipes the target from time. This horrifies Min and
                                    Nynaeve al'Meara and they turn to Cadsuane for help. Giving up on saving Arad Doman
                                    from the Seanchan and starvation, Rand returns to the city of Tear.</p>
                              <p> Nynaeve, under the instruction of Cadsuane, locates Tam al'Thor, Rand's father, who
                                    meets with Rand in an attempt to break his emotional isolation. Rand becomes angry
                                    when he learns that Tam was sent by Cadsuane, nearly killing his father before
                                    fleeing in horror at what he had almost done. Rand Travels to the Seanchan-held city
                                    of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act
                                    after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he Travels to
                                    the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry
                                    at the futility of life bound to the Wheel, he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough
                                    power to destroy the world. Lews Therin, a voice in Rand's head from his past life,
                                    suggests that by being reborn one has the opportunity to do things right. Agreeing,
                                    Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself, destroying it. Rand is
                                    finally able to laugh again.</p>
                              <h4>Plotline 2: Egwene al'Vere</h4>
                              <p> The second main plot thread follows Egwene al'Vere, leader of the rebel faction of Aes
                                    Sedai. After her capture by the White Tower in the previous book, Egwene works to
                                    undermine Elaida a'Roihan's rule and mend the strife it is causing in the White
                                    Tower.[15] She is initially granted freedom of the tower as novice, but after
                                    publicly denouncing Elaida, Elaida names her a follower of the Dark One,[16] and
                                    orders her imprisonment. When Elaida fails to prove her accusation, Egwene is
                                    released.</p>
                              <p> Egwene returns to her room to find Verin Mathwin, who announces that she is of the
                                    Black Ajah. Taking advantage of a loophole in the oath Verin had sworn that she
                                    could not betray them "until the hour of my death", she fatally poisons herself,
                                    allowing her to use her last hour to reveal everything she has learned to Egwene.
                                    Verin explains that although she was forced to swear to them or face death, she used
                                    the position to research the Ajah. She gives Egwene a journal detailing the group's
                                    structure and nearly every member before succumbing to the poison.</p>\
                              <p> When the Seanchan attack the White Tower, its fractured state prevents an effective
                                    defense. Many Aes Sedai are captured or killed until Egwene, leading a group of
                                    novices, succeeds in driving them off. Siuan Sanche, Gawyn Trakand, and Gareth Bryne
                                    mount a rescue of Egwene. They find her so exhausted that she cannot protest when
                                    they extract her against her orders. After awakening in the camp, she argues that
                                    they may have ruined her chances to gain credit in the Tower for the defeat of the
                                    Seanchan.</p>
                              <p> Egwene begins to expose the Black Ajah among the rebels, requiring every sister to
                                    re-swear her allegiances. Fifty sisters are exposed and executed, while twenty are
                                    able to escape. Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the
                                    Seanchan raid, the rebels prepare an immediate attack. Just before the attack is
                                    mounted, the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid,
                                    and that they would have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return
                                    and they begin rebuilding the Tower.</p>

                              <h4>Plotline 1: Perrin Aybara and Egwene al'Vere</h4>
                              <p> Moving through Ghealdan, Perrin Aybara and his followers encounter the Children of the
                                    Light, of whom Jaret Byar and Dain Bornhald accuse Perrin (correctly) of killing two
                                    of their colleagues. When Galad Damodred discovers his stepmother Morgase Trakand
                                    among the refugees, Galad and Perrin agree to a trial with Morgase as the judge
                                    under Andoran law. Perrin reveals his ability to speak with wolves and claims as his
                                    defense the fact that the two men killed his wolf friends; but Morgase judges Perrin
                                    guilty of "illegal killing" under an obscure law governing mercenaries. Perrin
                                    agrees to abide by Galad's ruling after Tarmon Gai'don; but Galad does not
                                    immediately pronounce sentence. </p>
                              <p> Faile Bashere and Berelain sur Paendrag agree that Berelain will publicly denounce the
                                    rumors that Perrin and Berelain were paramours during Faile's imprisonment;
                                    whereafter Berelain attaches herself to Galad. Nae'blis Moridin charges fellow
                                    Forsaken Graendal with killing Perrin; and he gives her a ter'angreal called a
                                    "dreamspike", one of two he possesses, that hinders both Traveling and movement in
                                    the real world, as well as the service of his minion Isam. Graendal orders Isam to
                                    plant the device so that Perrin's Asha'man Jur Grady and Fager Neald cannot form
                                    gateways, enabling her to destroy his forces with an army of Trollocs. Perrin enters
                                    into the dream world to remove it, but is attacked by Isam in the process. Despite
                                    superior numbers due to the wolves helping him, Isam's mastery of the dream world
                                    enables him to easily kill several wolves. Not wanting anyone else to be hurt,
                                    Perrin takes the dreamspike and lures Isam away, despite his movement being limited
                                    by the device, eventually reaching Tar Valon, with Isam in pursuit. </p>
                              <p> Egwene al'Vere plots to find the Forsaken Mesaana, while also dealing with a series of
                                    murders of Aes Sedai, but refuses to bond Gawyn Trakand as a Warder due to his
                                    disobedience; and when he confronts an intruder outside Egwene's chambers, it
                                    disrupts the wards she had set against Mesaana. Gawyn, while visiting Elayne in
                                    Caemlyn, learns that the murders are the work of 'Bloodknives', the Seanchan's
                                    assassins. Egwene arranges a meeting of the Hall of the Tower in Tel'aran'rhiod with
                                    the hidden agenda of drawing Mesaana into a trap while attending another secret
                                    meeting of Aes Sedai, Aiel Wise Ones, and Sea Folk Windfinders, to discuss
                                    cooperation among the channeling women of the three cultures. However, rather than
                                    simply spying on the Hall as intended, Mesaana and the Black Ajah immediately
                                    attack, causing a battle to ensue, with the dreamspike moved by Perrin keeping
                                    Mesaana from escaping. Mesaana attempts to hold Egwene with an a'dam; but Egwene's
                                    mastery of Tel'aran'rhiod enables her to break Mesaana's mind. Gawyn returns to Tar
                                    Valon to stop three Bloodknives from killing Egwene; whereupon Egwene awakens and
                                    bonds with Gawyn, whom she agrees to marry. </p>
                              <p> On the Tower grounds, Hopper and Perrin fight Isam, and Isam kills Hopper, forever
                                    ending any chance of a rebirth for the wolf.[11] Perrin destroys the dreamspike by
                                    dropping it into a nightmare that has taken the form of a volcano. Perrin escapes
                                    from Isam by returning to the real world. Perrin feels compelled to forge a war
                                    hammer, and Neald discovers a Talent for creating a Power-forged weapon, resulting
                                    in a hammer that Perrin names Mah'alleinir, "he who soars" in the Old Tongue.
                                    Meanwhile, Galad's Children are unaware that they are about to be ambushed by the
                                    Trolloc army intended for Perrin. Perrin's army attacks first, destroying the
                                    Trollocs and saving the Children. Galad sets a light sentence for Perrin's crimes:
                                    he must make financial restitution to the families of the two slain men and he must
                                    fight in the Last Battle. Jaret Byar attempts to kill Perrin, but Byar is instead
                                    killed by Dain Bornhald, who no longer believed that Perrin killed his father
                                    Geofram due to the inability of Byar to give evidence in favor of the charge at the
                                    trial. Galad accepts Perrin's proposal to join Perrin's force and swears to remain
                                    under Perrin's command until the last battle is over. </p>
                              <p> The Dark One's hand, Shaidar Haran, blames Forsaken Graendal for the deaths of three
                                    Forsaken (Mesaana, Aran'gar, and Asmodean), and begins to punish her. </p>
                              <h4>Mat Cauthon and Elayne Trakand</h4>
                              <p> Mat Cauthon meets Andoran Queen Elayne Trakand in Caemlyn to discuss building
                                    "dragons" (artillery) to former Illuminator Aludra's specifications. They bargain
                                    over who gets to keep how many dragons, and Mat agrees to let Elayne borrow the
                                    foxhead ter'angreal he wears to block the One Power, so that she can make copies.
                              </p>
                              <p> Elayne uses an angreal to weave a disguise, in an attempt to impersonate one of the
                                    Forsaken. She questions Black Sister Chesmal, but she is exposed after the arrival
                                    of Chesmal's Black Sisters Eldrith and Temaile, as well as the secretary of House
                                    Caeren's head Sylvase. She uses Mat's ter'angreal and a copy of it she made to
                                    defeat them, but after a surprise appearance by her Darkfriend former guard Doilen
                                    Mellar, she loses both medallions to him. In desperation, she uses the One Power to
                                    collapse the roof on him. She regains the original ter'angreal, but Mellar escapes
                                    with a copy. </p>
                              <p> Mat and Talmanes lure the gholam into a trap; after battling the creature into a
                                    burning building, Mat wounds it with Elayne's copies of his own medallion, and
                                    forces it into a Skimming gateway wherein he corners and pushes into the endless
                                    void, dooming to fall forever. </p>
                              <p> When Perrin and his group arrive, Morgase convinces Elayne to let Perrin administer
                                    the Two Rivers under Andoran rule. Elayne uses the dragons, and a promise of estates
                                    in Andor for Cairhienin nobles, to convince the Cairhienen to make her queen of
                                    Cairhien, uniting the kingdoms of Andor and Cairhien. </p>
                              <p> Mat, Thom Merrilin, and Noal enter the Tower of Ghenjei to rescue Moiraine Damodred,
                                    who has been thought dead since she fell through a ter'angreal portal while battling
                                    the Forsaken Lanfear. Guided by Mat’s luck through an extra-dimensional labyrinth,
                                    the three ward off the cunning Eelfinn with fire, music and the threat of iron
                                    weapons. Upon finding her, Mat strikes a bargain with the Eelfinn for safe passage
                                    outside, offering them 'half the light of the world'-his left eye plucked
                                    mercilessly from its socket. Though they begin to leave, the snake-like Aelfinn
                                    chase after them, Mat having left them out of the prior bargain. Noal, revealing
                                    himself as the folk hero Jain Farstrider, offers to stay behind and buy the others
                                    time to escape. Driven to a dead end, hope seems dead, until Mat realizes his
                                    ashandarei polearm is their key to safe passage from the Tower, rending the walls
                                    and earning their freedom. Safe outside, Moiraine awakes to reveal herself severely
                                    weakened in the One Power due to her capture (though in possession of a supremely
                                    powerful angreal), and in love with Thom, who gladly reciprocates. As they share
                                    news of the world with her, they prepare to find Rand before the Last Battle is
                                    begun. </p>
                              <h4>Rand al'Thor</h4>
                              <p> Fresh from his soul-saving epiphany on the slopes of Dragonmount, Rand al'Thor
                                    proceeds to the world to fight the Dark One's touch, his positive demeanor righting
                                    the wrongs the Shadow had been allowed to perpetrate. Much to the surprise of all
                                    involved, he then embarks to the White Tower to deliver a stunning announcement to
                                    Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat: he intends to shatter the remaining seals on the
                                    Dark One's prison in order to erect a more permanent replacement. Unable to convince
                                    him of the dangers, she concedes to meet him in one month's time at the Fields of
                                    Merrilor at his request. Desperate to delay what she could only believe was the doom
                                    of the world, Egwene hastens a plan to unite the nations of the world in hopes of
                                    stopping the Dragon's seeming madness. </p>
                              <p> After dispelling a pair of powerful Darkfriends within his own ranks of Tairens, he
                                    Travels with Min Farshaw to the ruined port of Bandar Eban, which he had abandoned
                                    to starvation and decay. His demeanor and influence brightened, he quickly proceeds
                                    to set the city right on its feet, feeding the hungry and raising the downtrodden.
                                    He then heads north to the beleaguered fortress of Maradon, the main city of
                                    Saldaea, seized by countless Shadowspawn descended from the Blight. Though bravely
                                    fought by forces commanded by famed general Rodel Ituralde, the forces of Light are
                                    hopelessly overwhelmed, the city on the brink of destruction. Enraged by the plight
                                    of the men he had nearly consigned to death, Rand places himself at the forefront of
                                    the Shadow's assault, and repels the horde of tens of thousands single-handedly with
                                    an unimaginable amount of the One Power. Unfortunately he is unable to help the
                                    nations of Kandor and Arafel which also are overwhelmed by Shadowspawn. </p>
                              <p> He now prepares to parley with the forces of the nations gathered at the Fields of
                                    Merrilor, poised precipitously close to the Blight border, and the advent of Tarmon
                                    Gai'don. At the end of the book, while sleeping at the Fields of Merrilor, the night
                                    before the parley, Rand hears a scream in a dream of a woman he does not recognize.
                                    Her face is different but he knows she is Mierin Eronaile, also known as Lanfear.
                                    She begs him to help her escape from the torture but the wall falls away and she
                                    tumbles into darkness. </p>
                              <h4>Aviendha</h4>
                              <p> Meanwhile, finally allowed to undertake the final test to becoming a Wise One,
                                    Aviendha journeys through the Aiel Waste, making her way to the ancient city of
                                    Rhuidean. During her trek, a wandering Aiel named Nakomi visits her and asks to
                                    share her fire; after beginning an innocuous conversation, the mysterious woman
                                    muses to Aviendha about the fate of the Aiel, once their toh to the Dragon has been
                                    met. The question perplexes Aviendha, and worries her, as it seems the Aiel might
                                    lose purpose and meaning once the Last Battle was fought. After arriving in Rhuidean
                                    and passing the final trial of the crystal columns (a comprehensive history of the
                                    'shame' of the Aiel, as seen through her ancestor's eyes), she attempts to learn
                                    more of the ter'angreal through which she had just passed by touching them. This
                                    inadvertently reveals to Aviendha what may be the future of the Aiel, where her own
                                    descendants begin a chain of events that would allow the Seanchan to overtake the
                                    wetlands, drive the Aiel into hiding, and systematically reduce them to pathetic
                                    scavengers, all knowledge of ji'e'toh abandoned, and finally driven to extinction.
                                    Faced with this crushing possibility, Aviendha leaves Rhuidean to find Rand,
                                    desperate for any chance to right this grim future. </p>
                              <h4>The Black Tower</h4>
                              <p> Mazrim Taim is ruling the black tower with an iron fist. Logain has been absent from
                                    the Black Tower for some time. Several of the Aes Sedai who have traveled to the
                                    tower originally sent by the leader of the Red Ajah have been given permission to
                                    bond some of the Soldiers and Dedicated; however, none have been bonded. The
                                    entirety of the Tower is guarded, entry and exit are strictly monitored, and the
                                    behavior of many Aes Sedai and Asha'man have changed significantly and disturbingly;
                                    some of Taim's most ardent detractors seem only to sing his praises, and behave as
                                    if in hollow imitation of themselves. Gateways fail upon construction, confining
                                    those within Tower grounds to the watch of Taim and his faithful. A small group of
                                    Soldiers and Dedicated, including Androl Genhald, Emarin, Jonneth, Canler and the
                                    Two Rivers Asha'man, denied the Dragon even though their skills may warrant it, take
                                    notice of the darkness that seems to grip the Tower and its inhabitants, and
                                    desperately try to glean Taim's intentions while managing their own escape to Logain
                                    and the Dragon Reborn. </p>

                              <p> The title A Memory of Light was previously intended to apply to a book containing the
                                    material in what are now books 12, 13 and 14.</p>
                              <h4>Plotline 1: The Field of Merrilor</h4>
                              <p> Rand al'Thor prepares a meeting of all the nations on the Field of Merrilor, to
                                    persuade them to fight in Tarmon Gai'don. Mat returns to Ebou Dar to locate Tuon,
                                    only to find the city crawling with assassins sent by one of her generals.[9] At the
                                    Black Tower, Logain Ablar is missing and Mazrim Taim is forcibly "Turning" people to
                                    the Shadow. The Asha'man still loyal to Logain, led by Androl Genhald and aided by
                                    Aes Sedai ambassador Pevara Tazanovni rescue Logain, defeating Taim and driving his
                                    Dreadlords from the Tower.[10] Rand's "price" of allegiance—a treaty called "The
                                    Dragon's Peace", in which borders are fixed and war is outlawed—and his plan to
                                    shatter the remaining seals of the Dark One's prison, lead to widespread argument;
                                    the latter resolved only when Moiraine Damodred quotes from the Prophecies of the
                                    Dragon, and convinces Egwene to break the seals herself. The Aiel, persuaded by
                                    Aviendha's post-apocalyptic visions during Towers of Midnight, demand to be subject
                                    to the treaty, as arbiters of any dispute. When Elayne Trakand remarks that peace
                                    cannot be maintained if the Seanchan are exempt, Rand agrees to persuade their
                                    cooperation, and appoints Elayne commander-in-chief of the armies formerly under
                                    himself. </p>
                              <h4>Plotline 2: The War</h4>
                              <p> Elayne dispatches her forces to four different campaigns, whereof Caemlyn is to be
                                    retaken by Andoran and Cairhienin troops; Egwene commands an army of Aes Sedai to
                                    reinforce Kandor, while Lan Mandragoran and the resurrected nation of Malkier hold
                                    Tarwin's Gap. Rand himself will lead the Aiel to face the Dark One. The four
                                    remaining "Great Captains" are attached to each campaign: Gareth Bryne in Kandor,
                                    Agelmar Jagad at Tarwin's Gap, Rodel Ituralde to Shayol Ghul, and Davram Bashere to
                                    serve Elayne directly. The campaigns turn to disaster when Graendal, now renamed
                                    Hessalam, Compels the commanders to err. Rand gains the support of the Seanchan by
                                    persuading Tuon in Ebou Dar that his authority, as the reincarnation of Lews Therin,
                                    supersedes hers. The Seanchan march to battle with Mat as one of their generals.
                                    Taking only Moiraine, Nynaeve al'Meara, and the sa'angreal Callandor, Rand confronts
                                    the Dark One's champion, Moridin; interrupted only when Rand makes contact with the
                                    Dark One. Meanwhile, Perrin Aybara enters Tel'aran'rhiod to protect Rand from
                                    Slayer. In this he is assisted by Lanfear; but wounded by Slayer and forced to
                                    retreat. Rand and Egwene learn that enemy agents have seized some of the Dark One's
                                    seals. Elayne's forces burn Caemlyn to force the Trollocs to pursue; but they are
                                    pursued also by a new force from the north, and saved by Logain and his loyal
                                    Asha'man. At Tarwin's Gap, the defenders are forced into a rout; while in Kandor,
                                    Egwene and the Aes Sedai are unexpectedly outflanked by the nation of Shara, under
                                    Demandred. Realizing that Mat's foxhead medallion makes him the only competent
                                    general immune to hostile 'Compulsion', Egwene gives him command of their forces,
                                    and Mat rallies the survivors at the Field of Merrilor. </p>
                              <h4>Plotline 3: The Last Battle</h4>
                              <p> To lure Demandred into risking his resources, Mat stages a public quarrel with Tuon,
                                    and the Seanchan depart the field. Perrin continues pursuit of Slayer. At Shayol
                                    Ghul, Graendal opposes the Aiel. When Demandred challenges the absent Rand, Gawyn
                                    Trakand attacks him directly and is mortally wounded. Later, his elder half-brother
                                    Galad Damodred is severely wounded in the same effort; but wounds Demandred before
                                    retreat. Mat's command post is attacked directly by Sharan forces, and Siuan Sanche
                                    is killed in the defense. Gareth Bryne loses reason and dies soon after. Elayne is
                                    waylaid by several Darkfriend Guardsmen including Doilin Mellar, who arrange a
                                    duplicate of Elayne to be seen dead. Faile's contingent arrive at Merrilor, but are
                                    almost immediately betrayed. Faile seizes the Horn of Valere (capable of recruiting
                                    deceased heroes), which she gives to Olver. </p>
                              <p> Androl and Pevara track down M'Hael and steal the remaining seals on the Dark One's
                                    prison. Egwene then asks Leilwin Shipless to be her warder and attacks M'Hael.
                                    M'Hael uses balefire to destroy a number of Aes Sedai. In the midst of her fight
                                    with M'Hael, Egwene creates a new weave, the "Flame of Tar Valon", capable of
                                    counteracting balefire, and sacrifices her own life to destroy M'Hael and his
                                    followers. Galad passes Mat's foxhead medallion to Lan, and Lan attacks Demandred,
                                    killing him in single combat by letting Demandred stab him, then decapitating the
                                    Forsaken while his blade is thus engaged. Olver sounds the Horn of Valere, summoning
                                    legendary heroes to rescue Elayne. Mat uses the Heroes and reinforcements from the
                                    Seanchan to sweep the field. </p>
                              <h4>Plotline 4: Shayol Ghul</h4>
                              <p> Outside the Pattern, Shai'tan and Rand duel by constructing their visions of what
                                    reality could be after Tarmon Gai'don, and ultimately achieve stalemate on the
                                    premise that the Pattern is incomplete in case of either's defeat. Perrin kills
                                    Slayer at the Pit of Doom, and later kills Lanfear before she can kill Moiraine
                                    (later revealed by Brandon Sanderson to be a faked death by Lanfear) Mat kills Padan
                                    Fain with his own dagger. Olver and the resurrected heroes win the battle, while
                                    Aviendha mentally enslaves Graendal. Rand resumes his duel with Moridin, during
                                    which Rand, Moiraine, and Nynaeve take control of Moridin and use his power to
                                    create a huge weave of saidar, saidin, and True Power combined. Seeing this, Logain
                                    breaks open the Dark One's prison, and Rand uses the huge weave of three powers,
                                    first to capture the Dark One, and later to re-create his prison without flaw. </p>
                              <h4>Epilogue</h4>
                              <p> Bereft of the Dark One's influence, the Blight dissolves. Mat reunites with Tuon, who
                                    reveals that she is pregnant by him; whereas Perrin locates Faile buried under
                                    Trolloc corpses, but alive, and inherits the throne of Saldaea. King Alsalam of Arad
                                    Doman is revealed to be dead, and Ituralde succeeds him. Cadsuane Melaidhrin is
                                    elected the new Amyrlin Seat, while Moghedien is captured by a sul'dam. Thom and
                                    Moiraine, Lan and Nynaeve, wait attendance on Rand, who is slowly dying of his
                                    wounds. A funeral pyre is held; but it is revealed that Rand had exchanged psyches
                                    with Moridin, and is therefore alive. No longer able to channel the One Power, Rand
                                    now has the ability to manipulate the Pattern directly, though it is unclear to what
                                    extent. He demonstrates this ability by lighting his pipe without the use of the One
                                    Power. </p>
                              <p> A Memory of Light was published January 8th, 2013, and was written by Brandon
                                    Sanderson using the detailed notes provied by late author Robert Jordan.</p>
